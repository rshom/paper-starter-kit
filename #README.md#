# Paper Starter Kit
## Russell Shomberg

### About

This is boilerplate code for writing a engineering paper using Markdown combined with python. Clone this repo and replace the paper-starter-kit.pmd with your own pmd or edit that file directly. ```make all``` or ```make $(fileformat)``` will run the code and produce the polished output documents.

### Credit

Almost everything here was stolen from Kieran Healy's "[The Plain Person's Guide to Plain Text Social Science](http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/plain-person-text.pdf)", a guide to software tools, aimed at graduate students in the social sciences. 

He uses R markdown, so I had to modify the code a bit to work with pweave
